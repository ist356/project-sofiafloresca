### What it does
This program allows the user to filter through a dataset of over 15000 movies by genre, release year, rating, and runtime. It then suggests up to three of the highest rated (by rotten tomatoes) movies that fit the user's criteria. It also displays a visualization of all of the movies that meet the user criteria and plots them by audience rating and rotten tomatoes critics rating. The other visualization it displays is a more general sample of 1500 movies plotted by a user choice of one factor (rating, runtime, release year) and the average rotten tomatoes critics rating.
